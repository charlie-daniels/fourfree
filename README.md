# fourfree

Designed because nobody sells 40 percent keyboards anymore.

## pcb

Created using KiCad with [marbastlib](https://github.com/ebastler/marbastlib) and a few handmade footprints.

Created Oct 2024.

## assembly

**ProMicro goes in upsidedown on the topside!!!**
This is why the pads are on the bottom and the pin labels seem flipped from the top.

### parts list 

**pcb** 

- 43x 1N4148W Diodes
- 43x Kailh Hotswap MX
- 1x Sparkfun Promicro
- 1x 2-pin Reset switch
- 1x 128x32 OLED (optional)
- 1x 2.75u PCB mount stabiliser
- 1x 2.25u PCB mount stabiliser
- 1x 2u PCB mount stabiliser

**case**

- 14x M2 screws...?
Case still being designed but should be screw in to the pcb mounting brackets, maybe 14 was overkill...

## firmware

This is just initial firmware made with [Keyboard Firmware Builder](https://kbfirmware.com/) by [Ruiqi Mao](https://ruiqimao.com/). The keymaps should work as expected as they are configured properly with the pinouts and key matrix.

## to be added

- Plate
- Case
- To see if the pcb actually works...
