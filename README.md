## assembly

**promicro goes in upsidedown on the topside!!!**
this is why the pads are on the bottom and the pin labels seem flipped from the top.

### parts list 

**pcb** 

- 43x 1N4148W diodes
- 43x Kailh hotswap MX
- 1x Sparkfun Promicro
- 1x 2-pin reset switch
- 1x 128x32 OLED (optional)
- 1x 2.75u pcb mount stabiliser
- 1x 2.25u pcb mount stabiliser
- 1x 2u pcb mount stabiliser

**case**

- 14x M2 screws...?
case still being designed but should be screw in to the pcb mounting brackets, maybe 14 was overkill...

## to be added

- firmware
- plate
- case
- to see if the pcb actually works
